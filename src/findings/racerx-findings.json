The brand announced the key players in the race team last week, and Jason Weigandt went to Angel Stadium to talk to them, including Ricky Carmichael, who sees himself as a general manager in picking talent, team principal Bobby Hewitt, and team manager Stephen “Scuba” Westfall, AMA Hall of Fame inductee Dave Arnold as lead chassis engineer, and Dudley Cramond joins as lead powertrain engineer. Jeremy Appleton, the global racing manager, joins Weigandt as well. We haven't seen the bikes yet, and the team isn't racing until 2024, but when you get to know the people behind the project, it becomes clear how seriously Triumph is taking this project.","podcast":"https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/25330296/height/90/theme/custom/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/render-playlist/no/custom-color/000000/","meta":{"title":"Podcast: Team Triumph Personel Talk Plans to Race in U.S. in 2024 - Racer X","url":"https://racerxonline.com/2022/12/14/exhaust-podcast-meet-team-triumph"}},{"title":"Exhaust Podcast Never Settle","date":"December 2, 2022 9:45am","description":"Cameron McAdoo wants it bad.

He did it the hard way, too, overcoming some big names in his consistent charges from the middle of the pack to the front. Loretta's longer, rougher motos (they increased to 25 minutes this year) helped showcase his skills and strength—the kind of stuff that matters more at the pro level compared to the sprint speed that defines a lot of amateur racing.","podcast":"https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/25161771/height/90/theme/custom/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/render-playlist/no/custom-color/000000/","meta":{"title":"Getting to Know Nicky Hayden AMA Motocross Horizon Award Winner Caden Braswell - Racer X","url":"https://racerxonline.com/2022/11/29/exhaust-podcast-meet-caden-braswell"}},{"title":"Exhaust Podcast Why JGRMX Mattered","date":"November 11, 2022 9:45am","description":"The sudden passing of Coy Gibbs on Sunday morning has given the entire motocross industry a chance to reflect on the legacy of Coy and the team he founded, JGRMX, which raced from 2008–2020. When the team was first announced in the summer of 2007, it seemed primed to dominate, with the Gibbs family's sterling reputation in both the NFL and NASCAR, as well as the resources it could pour into the team. Well, the revolution Coy Gibbs planned actually did come to the sport, as his Eastern-based team concept is now commonplace with other successful teams in the industry. JGRMX itself, however, won a few races but never the expected titles. This leads to two questions: Why did it not win more? And why does the legacy of this team, and its owner, feel much stronger than their results would indicate? Anyone who knew Coy and his team personally could tell you. This was an experience unlike any other.,Jason Weigandt dives in with this episode of the Racer X Exhaust podcast.","podcast":"https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/24980583/height/90/theme/custom/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/render-playlist/no/custom-color/000000/","meta":{"title":"Podcast: Jason Weigandt Explains JGRMX’s Big Picture Impact on Sport of Motocross - Racer X","url":"https://racerxonline.com/2022/11/11/exhaust-podcast-why-jgrmx-mattered"}},{"title":"Exhaust Podcast Forward March","date":"October 27, 2022 1:30pm","description":"Two years ago, Shane McElrath was battling Chase Sexton for a 250SX Regional Championship. Today, Sexton is a bright shining star in the sport with multiple 450 wins and championship potential of the highest order. McElrath, meanwhile, has been battling just to get a ride, anywhere. He missed most of the '21 season with a back injury, riding for SmarTop/Bullfrog Spas/MotoConcepts Honda. Then he ended up on four different teams in 2022, including one that folded, two fill-in rides, and then a a shot at building a team with Rick Ware Racing for the new World Supercross Championship. It was thrown together quickly, but Shane emerged with the SX2 Championship. Now, finally, he thinks he has some stability for the future, and a chance to show what he can do. Jason Weigandt chats with Shane in this podcast.","podcast":"https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/24823086/height/90/theme/custom/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/render-playlist/no/custom-color/000000/","meta":{"title":"Podcast: Shane McElrath on SX2 WSX Title, Racing for 4 Teams in 2022 - Racer X","url":"https://racerxonline.com/2022/10/27/exhaust-podcast-forward-march"}}]
